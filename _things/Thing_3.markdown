Ink Thing is our monthly Open Discussion Session where we all settle down together and plan out the projects we are going to target for the upcoming month. 

All you need to do is look up interesting projects, recent designs made with in the club, and things happening around you and share it with all of us. 

Highlights:
<ul>
<li> Ink. Projects Review. </li>
<li> Some Tips and Examples of/for Multi Exposure design. </li>
<li> Ink. Tank Planning - Need to decide the theme for next week. </li>
<li> New Projects/Assignments that have come across. </li>
<li> Website Review.</li>
</ul>

Not only is this fun but very informative, but crucial to the clubs functioning. Apart from a casual discussion over sponsored snacks we review the clubs activities and plan our way forward.
