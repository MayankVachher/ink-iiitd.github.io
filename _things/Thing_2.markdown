Our first session of the semester. 
These monthly sessions are conducted to give you an insight into design by looking back as well as exploring beyond.
It's an open discussion format, so don't shy away from attending, especially if you want to learn design.

For this session specifically, we'll tell you how to start contributing to our projects and ultimately earn membership. Apart from which we'll touch on some more things you need to be equipped with to become better designers.

What you need to bring? No photoshop/illustrator skills...only excitement and eagerness.

What you get? Goodies. Promise.
